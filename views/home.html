        <p>
            Helperbit wallet recovery is a tool that Helperbit has developed for ease of mind of its users: 
            its function is to free funds from your Helperbit wallet without our intervertion.
            <br>
            This means that should we disappear for any reason, including out of our control, 
            your funds are still available to you.
            <br>
            Helperbit wallet recovery can be downloaded from GitHub as a Zip (works with the Browser).
